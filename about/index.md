We are a organization that aims to develop our own projects and evolve our knowledge according to the evolution of the programming universe.

Our main mission is to develop all of our projects so that we help the greatest number of people to achieve greater productivity and thus obtain a better harmony between the user and the computer.

This website is to share with everyone all of our publications related to the programming universe, the entire development process of our projects (that same projects will be present at [GitHub](https://github.com/caffeinealgorithm){:target='_blank'}), all the videos that will be recorded to our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CaffeineAlgorithm){:target='_blank'} channel and probably something else (later).
