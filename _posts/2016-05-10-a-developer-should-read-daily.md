The best developers I know tend to read daily to update themselves regarding the programming universe that is and always will be constantly growing.

### You must read daily to be a good developer?

It's really important to read daily to constantly evolve as a good developer. Our universe is constantly growing and the technology continues to evolve so that means that it's necessary that a developer is constantly updated to improve his knowledge.

### If I usually read daily?

Yes and I can tell you that everyday I learn something new and that I gain even more interest in the programming universe. All my days are an adventure for me because there are endless things to learn.

I confess that I usually read books in Portable Document Format (.pdf) because it turns out to be more advantageous for me because I want to recreate the present exercises in the books I read in order to get a better learning experience (practice is the most important).

I hope you're having a great week.
