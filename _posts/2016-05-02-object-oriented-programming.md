Today's topic is about a paradigm called object-oriented programming.

### What is object-oriented programming?

The object-oriented programming is a paradigm widely used today and is based on the composition between different software units called objects and it implements a set of classes that define the objects in the software system.

Each class determines the behavior (defined in the methods) and possible states (attributes) of the objects as well as the relationship with other objects.

### Essential concepts

* **Class:** represents a set of objects and defines the behavior of the same through their methods and states which are capable of maintaining via their attributes;
* **Subclass:** a new class that inherits the characteristics of another class (or more classes);
* **Object:** an instance of a class that is capable of storing states through its attributes and responding to messages sent to him as well as relate and send messages to other objects;
* **Attribute:** the characteristics of an object and the data structure that will represent the class;
* **Method:** defines the "ability" of a particular object;
* **Message:** is the process of calling an object to invoke one of its methods and enabling a behavior described by its class;
* **Inheritance:** mechanism by which a class (subclass) can extend another class (superclass) to take advantage of their behavior (methods) and its possible variables (attributes);
* **Encapsulation:** is the separation of the internal and external aspects of an object and this mechanism is used to prevent direct access to the state of an object (attributes);
* **Abstraction:** the ability to focus on the essential aspects of any context ignoring minor or accidental features;
* **Polymorphism:** it's the principle by which two or more classes derived from the same superclass can invoke methods that have the same identification (signature) but different behaviors, specialized for each class;

### Object-oriented programming languages

C++, C#, VB.NET, Java, Objective-C, Python, Ruby, ...

We hope that your week has started in the best way.
