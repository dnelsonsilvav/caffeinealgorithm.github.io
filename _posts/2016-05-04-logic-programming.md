The topic of the day is related to the last of the four most popular paradigms in our programming universe.

### What is logic programming?

Logic programming is a programming paradigm that makes use of mathematical logic and it has strong links with the theoretical computer science.

Mathematicians and philosophers find in logic an effective tool for developing theories. In short, say a problem needs a solution often is equal to asking whether a new mortgage is consistent with an existing theory or is a consequence of it.

#### Advantages:

* Existence of efficient interference mechanisms that deduct the truth value of a formula in time (and space) linear in the number of constants of the formula;
* Existence of efficient interference mechanisms for diagnostic and learning;

#### Disadvantages (in complex areas is not allowed to):

* Representation of generic relationships between concepts represented in intent;
* Modular structuring of knowledge;
* Knowledge representation in dynamic environments or not deterministic/continuous;

### Logical programming languages

Prolog (deductive capacity, non-determinism, reversibility of relations, interpretation of logic programs and recursion), ...
