It's true, I no longer publish anything since 24 May and I confess that I missed to publish something in this same space.

During this whole time without publishing anything, I tried to gain further knowledge about everything that has to do with the programming universe to have a better preparation for my future as a developer.

I can also tell that I've several ideas for future projects and I should start each of them within a week or two to realize the potential of each.

In short, I took all this time without "concerns" to evolve, to give even more of me to the programming universe, to think of ideas for future projects, to grow as a person and thus become even more able to accomplish all my life goals.

Finally, I'll publish regularly again and I hope that you've enjoyed this moment of reading.
