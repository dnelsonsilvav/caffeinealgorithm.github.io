We're here today to write about imperative programming indicating its advantages and disadvantages.

### What is imperative programming?

Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that describes computation as actions, statements or commands that change the state (variables) of the program.

A program based on this paradigm consists of sequence structures (where a task is performed after the other), decision (from a logical test is executed or not a piece of code) and iteration (from a logical test is repeated for a finite number of times a piece of code).

#### Advantages:

* Efficiency;
* Dominant and well established paradigm;
* Natural modeling of real-world applications;
* It's easy to understand, widely used in introductory programming courses;

#### Disadvantages:

* Has difficult readability and facilitates the introduction of errors during their maintenace;
* It focuses on how the job should be done rather than what should be done;
* It tends to generate hard code where the processing of data is mixed with the behavior of the program;

### Imperative programming languages

Ada, Algol, Basic, C, PHP, Java, Cobol, Fortran, Pascal, Python, ...

The topic of tomorrow will be about the paradigm called logic programming and we hope you've enjoyed this moment of reading.
