In this second part I'll write about the navigation, communication, cloud and streaming applications that are present in my MacBook Air.

### Navigation applications (browsers)

#### [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/){:target='_blank'}
* No doubt a browser that fascinates me since I started to use due to its fast processing capabilities, security, fluidity, great variety of extensions and synchronization capabilities (you need a Firefox account to do so).

### Communication applications

#### [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/){:target='_blank'}
* The best communication application already established in my opinion that I use to socialize and work. I'm one of those people who loves the Skype graphic inteface and that dazzles with its proper functioning in relation to voice/video calls. I really like to be able to make screen sharing and to preview images and/or videos.

### Cloud applications

#### [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/){:target='_blank'}
* Dropbox is a service that hosts files, which provides synchronization of the same and cloud storage. I use it to make backups of all the files that I find important to have thus greater security.

### Streaming applications

#### [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/){:target='_blank'}
* This amazing application is a complete rewrite of the original OBS from the ground up with the main goals being multiplatform support with much more powerful API and allows me to stream and record what I'm doing in my MacBook Air.

#### [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/){:target='_blank'}
* I stopped listening to music on YouTube due to this amazing streaming application. It was a huge advantage for me to find out Spotify because it has facilitated my life.

I hope you're enjoying all this variety of applications and continuation of a good night.
