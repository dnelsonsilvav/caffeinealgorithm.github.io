Today is the day to write about the programming universe to realize what it is and perhaps understand why we love to develop.

### What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing, testing and maintenance of a particular computer program. This same program is written in a programming language, although it is possible (with some difficulty) to write it directly in machine language.

### What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a sequence of steps to accomplish a task or solve a problem and in our day-to-day we use algorithms to perform our activities, defining the sequence of activities that we must do to achieve a certain goal.

In summary, an algorithm is a abstract "program" and a step by step description of how the computer will perform a specific operation.

### What is a program?

A program is an entity that actually implements one or more operations in a way that is useful for the people who use it.

#### To create a program you must:

* Recognize the need for a program to solve a problem or do something;
* Plan the program and select the necessary tools to solve the problem;
* Write the program in the chosen programming language;
* Translate the readable code by man into executable code by machine using compilers;
* Test the program to make sure it works and that it solves the given problem;
