The weekend is about to start and the topic of the day is related to the importance of autonomy in a human being and I'll try to convey to you my point of view about this very important subject.

There are various kinds of autonomy of which autonomy in political science, in philosophy, in education, in space systems, ...

My kind of autonomy is autonomy in education because it was in high school that I began to be increasingly autonomous. I started to organize my own studies, to look for good sources of information and knowledge to construct a whole set of important information in order to accomplish my goals.

I believe that the main objective of teachers is only to guide and students must show their independence from the teachers being autonomous existing thus a greater freedom in the choice of paths and objectives of education which also means greater responsibility of the same.

In my opinion, an autonomous student is more likely to have a successful future and thus becomes even more able to achieve all his goals.

If you're a student, a teacher, a worker, a boss or just a person you will certainly have someone who commands your life and it's really important to be truly independent in relation to the same one so that you can achieve all your objectives in life.

Have a good weekend.
