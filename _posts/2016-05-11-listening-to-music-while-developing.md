title: 'Listening to music while developing'

We're almost in the middle of the week and I decided to write about how music is important to me when I'm programming.

A developer needs to abstract completely so that he can understand all the complicated algorithms that exist and thus develop according to that same algorithm.

We're not always able to abstract of the universe around us so that we can focus only on a particular problem and is at that exact moment that music appears to help us.

I've always been quite addicted to music and I don't have a favorite genre of music because that same changes depending on my mood (the type of music that I've heard lately is RnB).

When I feel that my current abstraction is not enough for several reasons previously created I put my headphones and I start listening to music isolating me so that my abstraction increases dramatically focusing me on a particular problem related to the programming universe.

If we evaluate my abstraction ability when I'm listening or not music it's very likely that the same is much higher when I'm listening music because I can see that my processing capacity is much faster because of my distraction and relaxation.

I hope you've enjoyed this moment of reading.
