The weekend has already started and today I've 3 Python projects for you.

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, dynamic programming language and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

Don't forget that Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming.
