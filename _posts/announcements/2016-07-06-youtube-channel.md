title: '[Announcement] YouTube channel'

Well, I'm writing this post to announce that I just created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CaffeineAlgorithm){:target='_blank'} to share with you all the videos that will be recorded to this organization (as was said in the [first post](http://caffeinealgorithm.com/introduction){:target='_blank'} of this blog).

Regarding the video content, it's logical that this same will be related to the programming universe because I only want to record programming tutorial videos and probably something else (later).

It's important to notice that this YouTube channel will be in Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil) because I'm Portuguese and I still have some difficulty speaking English.

I hope you enjoy and support this organization YouTube channel (don't forget to watch the video of the day).

Continuation of a good week.
