title: '[Announcement] Educational application'
date: 2016-05-24

The week has already started and today I'm here to announce that I'll start the development process of a new project.

That same project it's a educational application that directs to the children aged 5 to 9 years old (younger or older people can also use this application) and it will contain educational games where the subjects of the first cycle will be present.

When I finish this project I'll provide the setup file in this website so that you (future user of the same) can learn with this educational application and/or share it with your family and friends.

Don't forget that this application will be developed to work on Windows and that this same may also be (or not) developed to work on other operating systems and/or platforms.

Continuation of a good week.
