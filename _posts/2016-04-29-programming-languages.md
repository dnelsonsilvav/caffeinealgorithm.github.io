The weekend is about to begin and the topic of the day is related to our programming universe.

### What is a programming language?

A programming language is defined as a standardized method to communicate instructions to a computer or as a set of semantic and syntactic rules used to define a computer program.

The same can be converted or translated into machine code through build or interpreted methods by a process called interpretation (in both occurs the translation of the source code to machine code).

### The structure type

* Weakly typed: the type of variable that dynamically changes according to the situation;
* Strongly typed: the variable type (once assigned) that remains the same until it is discarded from memory;
* Dynamically typed: the variable type that is defined at runtime;
* Statically typed: the variable type that is defined at compile time;

### The degree of abstraction

* Low level: symbols that are a direct representation of machine code that will be generated (Assembly, etc);
* Medium level: symbols that can be directly translated into machine code, but also complex symbols which are converted by a compiler (C, C++, etc.);
* High level: more complex symbols, intelligible for human beings and non-executable directly by the machine at the level of algorithmic specification (Java, Pascal, SQL, etc.);

## Programming languages

Java, C, C++, Python, C#, PHP, JavaScript, Perl, Ruby, Assembly, Visual Basic, Swift, Objective-C, MATLAB, Pascal, R, ...

Have a good weekend.
