The week has already started and the topic of the day is related to the social networks.

### What is a social network?

A social network is a social structure made up of people and/or organizations that are connected by one or more types of relationships.

The social networks allow us to analyze how people reach their goals and how organizations develop their activity.

### Marketing on social networks

Marketing on social networks is more personal and interactive than any other medium and it's necessary to note that these new tools that arise every day are difficult to understand for the common user.

Professional management of marketing in social networks requires the study and knowledge of other areas such as virtual communities and connections.

### Types of social networks:

* Social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Youtube, etc);
* Professional networks (LinkedIn, etc)
* Community networks (social networks in neighborhoods or cities);
* Political networks;
* Military networks;
* Etc;

I hope you had a good day and I see you in the next post.
