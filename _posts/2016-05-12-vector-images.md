I remembered the importance of vector images in my life and decided to write about it.

### Why vector images?

From the moment that someone told me about vector images and Inkscape I fell automatically in love because vector images are based on points, lines, curves, shapes or polygons (mathematical vectors).

This means that a vector image will never lose any quality due to the vectors (paths) that are controlled by control points (nodes).

### Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape

The big difference between these two amazing vector images editors is that Adobe Illustrattor is expensive and Inkscape is completely free.

For me it's so much easier to use both because there are several things that don't exist in a vector images editor and in the other on exists (each has its own advantages).

Have a good night!
