Hi, this organization aims to represent my own projects and evolve my knowledge according to the evolution of the programming universe.

Its main mission is to develop all of my projects so that I can help the greatest number of people to achieve greater productivity and thus obtain a better harmony between the user and the computer.

This website is to share with everyone all of my posts related to the programming universe, the entire development process of my projects (that same projects will be present at [GitHub](https://github.com/caffeinealgorithm){:target='_blank'}), all the videos that will be recorded to this organization [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CaffeineAlgorithm){:target='_blank'} channel and probably something else (later).

Finally, if anyone has any questions or want to simply contact this organization, you can do so by sending an email to [caffeinealgorithm@gmail.com](mailto:caffeinealgorithm@gmail.com){:target='_blank'}.
