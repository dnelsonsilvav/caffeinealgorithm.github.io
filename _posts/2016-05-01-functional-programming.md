This is the first post of the month and today we're here to write about functional programming.

### What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm closely linked to mathematics and this same paradigm treats computing as an evaluation of mathematical functions in order to avoid mutable states or data.

#### Advantages:

* Efficient software building;
* High level of abstraction;
* No dependency on assignment operations;
* Absence of assignment operations;

#### Disadvantages:

* Difficulty in working with problems involving many variables;
* Inefficient implementations;

### Functional programming languages

Alice, Arc, Cat, Dylan, Haskell, Joy, Miranda, ML, Opa, R, Roy, Scala, Wolfram, ...

We hope you've enjoyed this moment of reading.
