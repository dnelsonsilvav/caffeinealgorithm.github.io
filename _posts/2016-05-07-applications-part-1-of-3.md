This post is divided into three parts and I'll write about all the apps that are installed on my MacBook Air (Windows 10) and share my opinion about each one.

### Development applications

#### [Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/){:target='_blank'}
* For me the best IDE ever created where I develop in C# (which is one of my favorite programming languages) and where I develop all my .NET applications (and so much more).

#### [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/){:target='_blank'}
* I confess that it's rare to take my Infiduino UNO R3 board but when I'm with it in my hand I always end up having so much fun with it and with all the components that I own.

### Text editing applications

#### [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/){:target='_blank'}
* Here is one of the best text editors I know who works perfectly well with all the existing programming languages. It has a large variety of plugins and there is a huge and integrated community that grows increasingly.

#### [Microsoft Office Professional 2016](https://products.office.com/en-US/){:target='_blank'}
* Microsoft Office is complemented by a set of applications and they are all quite good although I only use a small part of them to make reports and/or presentations.

### Image and video editing applications

#### [Adobe Illustrator / Premiere Pro CC 2015](https://www.adobe.com/en/products/catalog.html){:target='_blank'}
* Without a doubt that this applications are one of the best vector images and videos editors that contains a large variety of support editing tools and has a beautiful graphical interface.

#### [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/){:target='_blank'}
* An amazing vector images editor that is open source and has a very special value to me because it was using Inkscape that I fell in love for creating and editing vector images.

I hope you had a good day and tomorrow I'll put on the blog the second part of the three existing parts.
