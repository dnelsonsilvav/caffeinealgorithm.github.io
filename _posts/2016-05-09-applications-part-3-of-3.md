Finally we come to the third and final part related to the subject "Applications" and today I'll write about the rest of the applications that I use.

### Other applications

#### [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/){:target='_blank'}
* The proper application to insert the Raspbian or another operating system image (.img) on my Raspberry Pi B+ and to make backups of the same.

#### [Transmission](https://sourceforge.net/projects/trqtw/){:target='_blank'}
* The lightest BitTorrent client that I've ever used that is open source and the best in my opinion. It has an incredible functioning and a simple graphical interface.

#### [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html){:target='_blank'}
* This amazing application is open source and based on an Apache distribution that contains MariaDB, PHP, and Perl.

#### [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/){:target='_blank'}
* It's one of the applications that I use more and I consider that GitHub is the best web-based Git repository hosting service.

#### [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/){:target='_blank'}
* This is the open source application that I use to compress or decompress files and it's very light.

I expect that you have enjoyed this set of applications and I see you in the next post.
